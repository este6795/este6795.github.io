    <h1>Silly websites!</h1>
    <p>The Internet is vast and wide. It is estimated about <strong>1.1 billion</strong> websites exist with only <em>18%</em> of them being active.
    However only a couple of them manage to amuse me here are a couple I would like to search with you!</p>
    <h2>The Useless Web</h2>

    <p>Now here's a truly <strong>wacky</strong> website you can find a little amusing but fascianting!
    Pointer Pointer is a website that tracks your cursor and syncs it up with an image of a person pointing in that direction. 
    The interesting part though is, the images seem to be endless. No matter where your cursor is it always finds and image to sync to.</p>
