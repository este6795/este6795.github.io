        <h2>Who was John F. Kennedy?</h2>
        <p>
            John F. Kennedy, also known as JFK, was the 35th President of the United States.
             He was in office from from 1961 until his assassination in 1963.

            A charismatic leader, Kennedy inspired the nation with his vision for progress, famously declaring,
             “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” 
             His presidency was marked by pivotal events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the establishment of the Peace Corps,
              the Space Race, and early advancements in civil rights. Despite his short time in office,
               Kennedy's legacy endures as a symbol of youthful optimism and bold leadership.

        <h2>Why John F. Kennedy?</h2>
        <p>In my eyes, JFK was one of the greatest Presidents the United States ever had the honor of electing.
             His ambitions and dreams were contagious and awe-inspiring. Without John F. Kennedy, the United States
              might not have achieved the progress it enjoys today. He is a significant figure in our history
               and truly worthy of praise.
