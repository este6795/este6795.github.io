# Welcome to BACS 200-026

## In this repository we will mainly focus on the creation of a website...

## A few things to note

- This course is *mainly* concerned with **small busniness** website development
- Most of the website will use HTML as a means of creating functionality
- Keep in mind that this repository is **public** therefore others can view it

Other than that happy coding!
